1️⃣ Gap Submission & Tracking

Who: QA / Ops
Why: To actually raise a gap using the form templates you built.
To build:

“Raise New Gap” page → dynamically loads form template.

Save responses + attachments in DB (Gap table).

Status flow: PendingAI → PendingReview → Assigned → InProgress → Resolved → Closed → Reopened.

Each gap links to:

Template used

Created by (QA/Ops user)

Department/team

✅ Once this works, your system becomes functional.

2️⃣ AI Validation (Duplicate Check + SOP Suggestion) (Open router wth option to choose custom model)

Who: Automatic via OpenRouter AI
Why: To detect if the submitted gap is similar to a past one.
To build:

On new gap submission → send title + description to AI (OpenRouter API).

Compare embeddings with past gaps.

If similar → mark as “AI-Flagged” and attach suggestions.

If duplicate → notify management to decide (Approve as new / Discard).

If SOP exists → show “AI Suggested SOP: [link]”.

✅ This is your USP feature — must be handled cleanly.

3️⃣ Management Review & Assignment

Who: Manager / Team Lead / admin 
Why: To review AI flags and assign tasks.
To build:

“Pending Review” dashboard showing flagged/new gaps.

Buttons:

✅ Approve & Assign (choose POC, set Priority, Severity, TAT)

❌ Mark as Duplicate (discard + send email to reporter)

⚙️ Override AI (treat as new gap)

Add priority, severity, tat_deadline, assigned_poc_id.

✅ This gives your app workflow authority.

4️⃣ POC Workflow

Who: POC users
Why: To act on assigned gaps.
To build:

“My Assigned Gaps” list (filter by priority/severity/status).

Each gap detail view includes:

Chat-like thread for communication

File uploads (proof, screenshots)

Buttons: “Resolve”, “Request TAT Extension”, “Close”

When resolved → reporter (QA/Ops) gets mail and can reopen if unsatisfied.

✅ This enables the full gap lifecycle.

5️⃣ TAT & Escalation Logic

Who: System automated
Why: For SLA compliance and auto-escalation.
To build:

Background job (cron or scheduler) checks gaps daily:

If now > tat_deadline and not resolved → mark as “Overdue”.

Auto-email escalation to Manager + CC Admin.

POC can request extension → goes to Manager approval flow.

✅ Ensures accountability.

6️⃣ Reopen Flow

Who: QA / Ops
Why: To ensure satisfaction after resolution.
To build:

Allow “Reopen Gap” button on closed gaps (within X days).

Notify assigned POC + Manager.

Increment “Reopen count” for POC metrics.

✅ Improves transparency & data quality.

7️⃣ Notification System

Why: Keep everyone updated automatically.
To build:

Email (Send grid ) for:

Assignment

Duplicate rejection

Closure

TAT breach

Reopen

Optional: add Socket.io for instant dashboard updates.

✅ Makes system feel alive.

8️⃣ Dashboards & Reports

Who: Management / Admin
Why: Track performance and efficiency.
To build:

Management view:

QA/Ops metrics → Gaps raised, Validated, SOP impact

POC metrics → Closed, TAT breaches, Reopen rate, SOP usage

Admin view:

All metrics + AI logs, escalation history, and reports.

Charts → Recharts or Chart.js

✅ Turns data into insights.

9️⃣ Audit & Logging

Why: Compliance and accountability.
To build:

AuditLog table: { id, action, user_id, gap_id, details, createdAt }

Log every: Assign, Close, Reopen, Extension request/approval.

Admin-only viewer page.

✅ Critical for traceability.
